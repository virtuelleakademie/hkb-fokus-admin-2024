## Introduction

Universities face unique challenges with LLMs like ChatGPT because they:

- Bypass traditional technology evaluation processes
- Enter through spontaneous adoption
- Require reactive rather than proactive policies

## Traditional vs. Arrival Technologies

**Traditional Adoption**

- Careful evaluation
- Committee review
- Pilot testing
- Staff training
- Clear timelines
- Established policies

**Arrival Technologies**

- Spontaneous use
- Bypass processes
- No preparation
- User-led adoption
- Reactive policies
- Informal training

## Real-World Examples

### Three Paths of Arrival

1. **Student-Led**
   - Spontaneous use in assignments
   - Adoption of AI-enabled tools
   - Creative applications

2. **Staff-Led**
   - Discovery of AI tools
   - Informal adoption
   - Peer-to-peer sharing

3. **System-Led**
   - AI features in existing software
   - Integration into common tools
   - Platform updates

## Understanding LLMs

- Pattern matching systems trained on text data
- Statistical models predicting likely next words
- Not intelligent systems
- Sophisticated imitation engines

## How LLMs Work

### Core Mechanism: Conditional Text Generation

1. Takes input as context
2. Predicts likely next word
3. Uses new context
4. Continues prediction process
5. Generates complete response

## Verification Methods

- Cross-reference with authoritative sources
- Check internal consistency
- Look for outdated information
- Watch for AI indicators:
  - Overly confident tone
  - Generic examples
  - Repetitive patterns
  - Unnatural language

## Critical Concerns

### Privacy Risks
- Data retention in training
- FERPA considerations
- Confidential information
- Institutional data

### Copyright and IP
- Ownership questions
- Training data rights
- Plagiarism risks
- Legal considerations

## Security and Access

### Data Security
- Third-party vendor access
- Cross-border data flow
- Retention policies
- Access control

### Equity Concerns
- Access to paid tools
- Technical literacy
- Resource disparities
- Training needs

## Practical Applications

Current Uses:
- Email and correspondence
- Document processing
- Report generation
- Data organization
- Process documentation

## Managing Arrival Technology

### Immediate Steps
1. Acknowledge current use
2. Share best practices
3. Develop guidelines
4. Address key concerns

### Long-term Strategy
1. Create comprehensive policies
2. Establish training programs
3. Monitor impacts
4. Adapt to changes

## Looking Forward

Key Questions:
1. How is your department adapting?
2. What guidelines are needed?
3. How can we ensure responsible use?
4. What support do staff need?

## Next Steps

1. Document current uses
2. Share experiences
3. Develop policies
4. Plan training
